*                    Course logo - A local moodle plugin.                      *
********************************************************************************

The course logo plugin provides a place where priviledged users within a Moodle
course can upload an image that relates to the course.
That image can then be used by theme designers and displayed anywhere they want
within their theme.
It is important to note that this plugin is probably not the best way to go
about this however it does work.
More information on this plugin, how to install and use it are included within
the README file that comes with this plugin.

                              Theme Integration
********************************************************************************

After installing this plugin you will want to edit your theme to make use of the
images associated with your courses.

1. Creating and using an <img> tag.

The easiest way to use this the course logo is to generate an <img> tag and 
simply use that within your HTML.

Before we begin first put your default logo into your theme's pix directory and
name it defaultlogo, you can change this if you want but I've used it for the 
following examples.

First open your layout file e.g. theme/yourtheme/layout/general.php
Somewhere in the first php block (before echo $OUTPUT->doctype()) add the 
following code:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
require_once($CFG->dirroot.'/local/courselogo/lib.php');
$logoimg = local_courselogo_get_logo_html($PAGE->course, 'defaultlogo');
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then where ever you want to use the <img> tag within your theme just use the
following:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?php echo $logoimg; ?>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Generating CSS and a background image style.

It is possible to use the logo within CSS as a background image as well if you 
would prefer to to do that.
Within your layout file(s) you would have to add the following block of code
within the <head> tag for you page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<?php
require_once($CFG->dirroot.'/local/courselogo/lib.php');
$course = $PAGE->course;
$url = local_courselogo_get_logo_url($course, 'defaultlogo');
echo '<style type="text/css">';
echo ".course-{$course->id} .customcourselogo {background-image:url($url);}";
echo '</style>';
?>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will produce a snippet of CSS that will be class based (to avoid caching)
and will display the image as a background image within any element you put add
the class 'customcourselogo' to.

up with orphaned files in your file system.

Doing this just makes sure all uploaded images are deleted.
